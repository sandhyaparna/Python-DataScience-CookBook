* Difference between a list, a set, and a tuple.
  * Lists are enclosed in brackets: l = [1, 2, "a"]
  * Tuples are enclosed in parentheses: t = (1, 2, "a") - Tuples are faster and consume less memory. 
  * Dictionaries are built with curly brackets:d = {"a":1, "b":2} - To initialize dict use dict() or {}
  * Sets are made using the set() builtin function - To initialize empty set using set function
* Loops in Python
  * While loop - With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp </br>
