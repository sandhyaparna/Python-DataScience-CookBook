""" Pandas Profiling is another package that automatically conducts exploratory data analysis and consolidates it into a report. I find this extremely useful to use when Iâ€™m 
working with smaller datasets. The best part is that it requires only one line of code! """

""" Gradio is a Python package that allows you to build and deploy a web app for your machine learning model in as little as three lines of code. It serves the same purpose as 
Streamlit or Flask, but I found it much faster and easier to get a model deployed."""

""" CLIP: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/03/beginners-guide-clip-model.html
* You can input an image into the CLIP model, and it will return for you the likeliest caption or summary of that image
* "Zero-shot learning" is when a model attempts to predict a class it saw zero times in the training data. 
* CLIP model is:
  * a neural network model built on hundreds of millions of images and captions,
  * can return the best caption given an image, and
  * has impressive "zero-shot" capabilities, making it able to accurately predict entire classes it's never seen before!
* The CLIP model consists of two sub-models called encoders:
  * a text encoder that will embed (smash) text into mathematical space.
  * an image encoder that will embed (smash) images into mathematical space.
* Output from text encoder & image encoder i.e embedded representations from both encoders are compared using cosine similarity. </br>
If cosine similarity between 2 encoders is high implies the model is good
