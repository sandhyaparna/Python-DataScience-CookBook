# Different metrrics for classification, Reg, clustering etc - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.metrics

# Stability of a model is very important i.e model should have similar performance metrics across both training and validation.
# Comparision of both training & test performance helps us to identify overfit models

# True Positives = Actual True & Predicted True
# False Positives = Actual False & Predicted True - False Alarm/Type I error
# False Negatives = Actual True & Predicted False - Missed Cases/Type II error
# True Negatives = Actual False & Predicted False - Correct Rejection

# Sensitivity/Recall/Hit rate/True Positive rate = TP/Overall Actual Positives = (1-False Positive rate)
# Specificity/Selectivity/True Negative rate = TN/Overall Actual Negatives
# Precision or PPV = TP/Predicted Positive
# Accuracy/Concordance = (TP+TN)/Total cases
# Misclassification rate = (FP+FN)/Total cases
# F1 Score = Harmonic mean of Precision and sensitivity = (2.TP)/(2.TP+FP+FN) = 2.(Precision).(Recall)/(Precision+Recall)
# F0.5 Score = Weighs precision(PPV) higher than recall
# F2 SCore = Weighs precision(PPV) lower than recall
  # F_beta = [(1 + beta^2).(precision.recall)] / [(beta^2 .precision) + (recall)]
#  
  
# ROC Curve - Summarizes performance of a classifier over all possible thresholds. (TP rate vs FP rate) or (Sensitivity vs 1-Specificity)
# AUC is area under ROC curve - Measure of seperability. Tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes / Tells how good is the model for a given observation. 70 auc implies 70% chance that model is capable of distinguishing between classes
# For multi-class, we can plot N AUC-ROC curves N classes using 1 vs All methodology. For eg if u have 3 classes named X,Y,Z 
# 1st ROC is X against Y&Z, 2nd is Y against (X&Z), 3rd is Z against (X&Y)
# AUC of 70% desirable

# ROC curves are used when there are roughly equal number of observations for each class
# Precision-Recall curves should be used there is a moderate to large class imbalance

# Preciison-Recall vs Thresholds: As Decision threshold inc, Sensitivity/Recall dec, Specificity & Precision inc

# https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/DataMining/Lift%20Charts.html
# ---Observations are ordered based on decreasing order of Predicted probability and then deciles/groups are created
# Each group is x% of overall population 
# In Decision tree -  observations within each node will have a certain prediction probability and each node is a bar in lift chart

# Gains/Lift Chart - Graph inc
# Top few deciles helps in capturing most of the True cases
# (X-axis - % of All cases) vs (Y-axis - % of True Cases ) - Line Graph is the cummulative % of true cases by each cumulative decile/group

# Actual vs Predicted - Graph dec
# (X-axis - % of All cases) vs (Y-axis - Count of True Cases) - Line graph with 2 lines-one for actual and one for predicted, lines are not cumulative true cases but they are count of true cases wrt to that decile population

# Lift Chart - Graph dec
# http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~dbd/cs831/notes/lift_chart/lift_chart.html
# The lift chart shows how much more likely we are to receive positive responses than if we contact a random sample of customers. 
# Lift value of each decile - Cumulative % of True cases till that decile / Cumulative % of population till that decile

# K-S Kolomogorov Smirnov Chart - http://www.saedsayad.com/model_evaluation_c.htm
# https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/7-important-model-evaluation-error-metrics/
# K-S is a measure of the degree of separation between the positive and negative distributions
# Here the observations are ordered in increasing order of Predicted probability to create deciles
# For each decile - Calculate counts, cumulative counts, cumulative count% of 1s and 0s for each decile
# K-S value for each decile is the difference between Cumulative 1s % and cumulatiev 0s % - Max k-s value within all deciles is the final K-S stat

# Cost Function - https://towardsdatascience.com/model-performance-cost-functions-for-classification-models-a7b1b00ba60
# False_Positives = abs(fpr * Actual Negatives)
# True_Positives = abs(tpr * Actual Positives)
# Specificity = 1-fpr
# True_Negatives = abs(Specificity*Actual Negatives)
# False_Negatives = abs(Total - False_Positives - True_Positives - True_Negatives)
# Cost Function (Incurred) = True_Positives*(Cost Incurred for intervention - Cost Saved)  +  False_Positives*(Cost incurred for intervention)  +
#                            False_Negatives*(Cost if there is NO intervention)

# Multi-class classification Problem
# Quadratic Weighted Kappa - which measures the agreement between two ratings. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters). In the event that there is less agreement between the raters than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0. The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated between the scores which are expected/known and the predicted scores. 
# https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2019/overview/evaluation
# 5 step breakdown for Weighted Kappa Metric
  # First, create a multi class confusion matrix O between predicted and actual ratings.
  #   # Second, construct a weight matrix w which calculates the weight between the actual and predicted ratings.
  wi,j=(i−j)2(N−1)2
  # Third, calculate value_counts() for each rating in preds and actuals.
  #   # Fourth, calculate E, which is the outer product of two value_count vectors
  # Fifth, normalise the E and O matrix
  # Caclulate, weighted kappa as per formula

# Dice coefficient
# The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. 
# The formula is given by:  2∗|X∩Y||X|+|Y|
# where X is the predicted set of pixels and Y is the ground truth. The Dice coefficient is defined to be 1 when both X and Y are empty.
