# Week3 - CNN
# Week4 - Image Generator

* Training Neural Networks 
  * model.compile to set optimizer and loss function
  * model.fit on train data
  * model.evaluate on test data gives loss and acc
  * model.predict gives the probability of targets 0,1,2 etc
* Image DataSet 
  * How to load data that is already present in tf.keras datasets API as training and test images and their labels
  * How to standardize data from images for Neural networks
  * model.predict of a particular observation gives the probability of that obs being classifies as 0,1,2,3 etc (depends on number of target labels)
  * As number of neurons in tf.keras.layers.Dense layer increases - accuracy of model inc along with time to train
  * Number of Neurons in the last layer should always match the number of classes u are classifying for
  * First layer in your network should be the same shape as your data
  * callbacks is used to stop training on more epochs if desired value of loss or accuracy is obtained
* CNN on Image
  * Convolution is added on top of NN in model
  * Filters generated in tf.keras.layers.Conv2D are not random. They start with a set of known good filters in a similar 
    way to the pattern fitting that you saw earlier, and the ones that work from that set are learned over time.
  * tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2) implies max value out of the 4 values of 2*2 matrix survives
 
### Neural Networks
# keras is a Tensorflow API
# Dense - layers of connection
# Units - Number of Neurons
# Sequential - Successive layers are defined in Sequence
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
# NN with 1 layer and that layer has 1 neuron and the input shape to it is just 1 value
model = keras.sequential([keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])

# Loss functions - Measure how good the current guess is
# Optimizer - First NN starts with a guess and then optimizer is used to improve upon it. It generates a new and improved guess
# (sgd - stochastic gradient descent)
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', #'adam'
              loss='mean_squared_error', #'sparse_categorical_crossentropy'
              metrics=['accuracy']) #

# xs - Input data
# ys - Target var
# epochs - Number of training loops 
model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)
model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=5)

# First layer corresponds to input - shape to be expected for the data to be in. Flatten is used to take image to convert it into a simple array
# Each image in MNIST data is represented as 28*28 array of (rows and columns)
# Last layer corresponds to diff Target classes
